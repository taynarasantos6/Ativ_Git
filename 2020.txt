Wait a Minute!
WILLOW

Wait a minute!
I think I left my conscience
On your front doorstep

Wait a minute!
I think I left my consciousness
In the sixth dimension

But I'm here right now, right now
Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow
I'm here right now, right now with you
Oh wow, oh wow

I don't even care
I'll run my hands through your hair
You wanna run your fingers through mine
But my dreads too thick and that's alright

Hold on, wait a minute!
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute!
I left my consciousness
In the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me

You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages
Do you really love me, baby

Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me

But I broke my word
And you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said: Oel ngati kameie

Hold on, wait a minute!
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute!
I left my consciousness
In the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

Some people like to live
Some just tryin' to get by
Some people like that hurt
Some just rather say goodbye, bye

Hold on, wait a minute!
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute!
I left my consciousness
In the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

(Let's go get it)
(Let's go get it)
